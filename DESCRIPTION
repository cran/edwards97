Description: Implements the Edwards (1997) <doi:10.1002/j.1551-8833.1997.tb08229.x>
    Langmuir-based semi-empirical coagulation model, which predicts the concentration
    of organic carbon remaining in water after treatment with an Al- or Fe-based
    coagulant. Data and methods are provided to optimise empirical coefficients.
